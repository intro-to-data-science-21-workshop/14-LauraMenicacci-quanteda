# Working with quanteda


## Summary

This repository provides materials for the session on quanteda that is part of the [I2DS Tools for Data Science workshop](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-21-workshop) run at the [Hertie School, Berlin](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) in November 2021. The student-run workshop is part of the course [Introduction to Data Science](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-21) taught by Simon Munzert at the Hertie School, Berlin, in Fall 2021.

### Session contents

This session will introduce you to quantitative text analysis with R and quanteda. Quantitative text analysis is a key competence as most of the available data of the world exists in text form and is constantly increasing in volume. quanteda is a package that allows you to preprocess, manipulate and analyze text in a straightforward and intuitive way. It mainly follows the tidyverse grammar and can easily be combined with other packages. In addition, this session will introduce you to the Manifesto Project Database, which provides information about electoral programmes of more than 50 countries.

### Main learning objectives

The goals of this session are to (1) make you familiar with the idea possible applications of quantitative text analysis (2) equip you with conceptual knowledge about the quanteda package and a typical workflow of quantitative text analysis, and (3) provide you with practical skills how to work with the basic objects of quanteda
